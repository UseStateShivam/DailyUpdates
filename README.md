# DailyUpdates
well today is 14 July 2024, I am making this repo to keep a daily record of myself and update what all "STUFF" I do. 
as of 14 July 2024 i am working in a non funded startup where I am (as of now) the sole web developer.
the goal that i am setting for the next 100 days is as follows
  1) stick to the startup, gain knowledge and get taht initial production expreince without the demand of money, money follows skill after all
  2) start working on a saas aplication project that uses ai in some sort, and by the way lear about deep learing through that
  3) also make a saas casino (idk what i am gonna do with that, its just a thing that i have in my mind)
  4) 3 commits/day fro the next 100 days
  5) finally build a dashing protfolio.......
